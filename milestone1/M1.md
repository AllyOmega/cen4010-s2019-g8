This is the official document for milestone one


1) Executive Summary

What makes an university great? It’s students, it’s faculty, and it’s Administrators. A great university has involved students who contribute to the academic and social life of the university. It also has a passionate faculty that nurture the creative spirits of the student body. And at the administration level you find equally engaged leaders that attentively manage all of the aspects of the University. Our goal with Owl Board is to empower every student, faculty and administrator to work more efficiently and in sync in their quest to make their university a great learning institution. 

Owl board is a social network that allows students and faculty to report issues found in their University directly to the administrators, who will also able to respond and update students on their progress fixing said issues, in real time. Students and faculty will be able to report all issues found on campus (broken equipment, problems with facilities, etc) from the owl board application, empowering them to directly affect the well-being of their learning institutions.  Administrators would also benefit from Owl Board by being able to share some of the administrative responsibility with the student and faculty body. Owl Board would also allow all participants to post upcoming campus events, club meetings, guest speakers and so on: making it very easy for all students to socialize and get involved in their University’s extracurricular activities.

Owl Board is our vision for a more perfect University system. Where all relevant parties (be it students or administrators) will gain the ability to easily communicate with one another and work more in sync towards what is truly important: creating an awesome place for education and the exploration of ideas. We envision a near future in which schools (Universities, colleges, high schools, etc) use Owl Board to socialize with their peers but also contribute to the well being of the institutions they attend, improving the quality of education world-wide. 

2) Competitive analysis

Analyzing  competitive  products  available  today.  Present  competitors’  features  vs. 
planned  ones.  First,  create  a  table  with  key  features  of 
competitors  vs.  yours. Only  at  very  high  level,  5-6  entries  max.  After  the  table, 
you  must  summarize  what are the planned advantages or competitive relationship to what is 

3) Data definition

This section serves as the “dictionary” of your document. It defines main terms, data structures and “items” or “entities” at high or 
logical (not implementation) level (e.g. name, meaning, usage, and NOT how the data is stored in memory) so it is easier to refer  
to  them  in  the  document.  Focus  on  key  terms  (main  data  elements,  actors, types of users etc.) specific for your application 
and not on general well know terms. These   terms   and   their   names   must   be   used   consistently   from   then   on   in
all documents,  user  interface,  in  naming  software  components  and  database  elements etc. In later milestones, you will add more 
implementation details for each item. You will later expand this section with more details.

4) Overview, scenarios and use cases
This  section  describes  the  project  overview  (in  much  more  details)  and  likelihood usage  
scenarios  of  your  product  from  end  users’  perspectives.  Focus  only  on  main use  cases.  Simple  text  format  is  OK  and  
preferable  –  tell  us  a  story  about  who  and how is the application used. Focus on WHAT users do, their skill level, not on HOW the 
system  is  implemented.  You  can  expand  use  cases  provided  in  high  level document in future milestones.

5) Initial list of high-level functional requirements
This refers to the high-level functionality that you plan to develop to the best of your knowledge  at  this  point.    
Focus  on  WHAT  and  not  HOW.  Keep  the  users  in  mind. Develop  these  functions  to  be  consistent  with  use  cases  
and  requirements  above. Number  each  requirement  and  use  these  numbers  consistently  from  now  on.  For each functionality 
use 1-5 line description.6List of non-functional requirementsFor    example,    performance,    usability,    accessibility,    
expected    load,    security requirements, storage, availability, fault tolerance etc.  
Number each. When possible, try to quantify these quality attributes.

7) High-level system architecture
Lists of main software products, tools, languages and systems to be used, list of core APIs available 
at this point, supported browsers etc. You  also  have  to  decide  on  which  frameworks  you  will  use  if  any.  These  provide 
both  user  interface,  as  well  as  cross-platform  and  cross  browser  layout/css.  
All external code you plan to use must be listed along with their license. 

8) Team
List  student  group  names,  name  of  Scrum  master,  product  owner  and  initial  roles for each member

9) Checklist
For  each  item  below  you  must  answer  with  only  one  of  the  following:  DONE,  ON TRACK  (meaning  it  will  be 
done  on  time,  and  no  issues  perceived)  or  ISSUE  (you have  some  problems,  and  then  define  what  is  the  problem  
with  1-3  lines).  

Reflect these items in your Trello project space:
a)   Team decided on basic means of communications
b)   Team found a time slot to meet outside of the class
c)   Front and back end team leads chosen
d)   Github master chosen
e)   Team ready and able to use the chosen back and front-end frameworks
f)    Skills of each team member defined and known to all
g)   Team   lead   ensured   that   all   team   members   read   the   final   M1   and agree/understand it before submission
